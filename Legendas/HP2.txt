1
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,199
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,911
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,291
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon-
Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,711
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,218
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,349
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,351
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,023
If l could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,110
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,407
But l haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,242
Not one...

12
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,119
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,539
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,252
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,923
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,928
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,597
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,100
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,604
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,731
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,568
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,656
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- l'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,741
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,122
And you?

26
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,086
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that l don't exist.

27
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,963
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,633
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,387
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:15,319
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,119
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,204
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,333
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,003
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,298
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,303
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,309
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:54,025
Dobby, l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,360
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,863
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:04,827
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,372
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,000
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,878
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,007
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,550
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,682
Don't mind that. lt's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,189
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,608
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,236
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,615
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,744
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,914
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,625
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:05:00,049
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,551
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,390
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:12,728
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,232
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,568
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,741
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. l-

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,454
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,667
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,839
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,968
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,140
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,352
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- l was just-

68
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,272
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,274
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,946
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,867
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,787

See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,708
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,504
- lt's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,632
Well, l expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,471
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,974
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,353
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,191
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:45,821
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,378
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,885
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:12,223
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,017
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:21,273
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,445
 lt spread as far as the eye
could see, all over the floor.

87
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,572
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,742
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,591
I'm so sorry. lt's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,096
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,277

You're never going back to that school.

92
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:11,490
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,787
Hiya, Harry.

94
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:04,335
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

95
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,380
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

96
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,805
You better stand back.

97
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,350
Let's go.

98
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,023
- What was that?
- What was it?

99
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,527

Potter!

100
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,363

Dad, what's going on?

101
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,659
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,868

Dad, hurry up.

103
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,914
 Come on.
Come on, Harry, hurry up.

104
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,709
Petunia, he's escaping!

105
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,421
 l've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

106
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,715
 Let go of me!
- No, boy!

107
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,885
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,679
- Get off!
- Drive!

109
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,722
 Right.
Right!

110
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,557

No! No! No! No!

111
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,730

Dad!

112
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,366
Damn.

113
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,374
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

114
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,485

Come on.

115
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,115
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

116
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,160
Okay, come on.

117
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,420
 Think it'd be all right
if we had some?

118
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,464

Yeah, Mum will never know.

119
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,359
It's not much, but it's home.

120
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,819
I think it's brilliant.

121
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,324
Where have you been?

122
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,786
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

123
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,539
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

124
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,709
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

125
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,962
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

126
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,132
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

127
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,054
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

128
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,348
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

129
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,310

Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

130
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,022
That's it. There we go.

131
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,026
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

132
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,320
Hello.

133
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,992
What did l do?

134
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,747
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

135
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,542
- Morning, Weasleys.
FAMlLY: Morning, Dad.

136
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,255
 What a night. Nine raids.
- Raids?

137
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,384
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

138
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,887
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

139
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,265
Well, now.

140
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,393
And who are you?

141
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,730
Oh, sorry, sir. l'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

142
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,025
Good Lord. Are you really?

143
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,905
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

144
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,574
This morning.

145
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,996
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

146
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,583
Did you really? How did it go?

147
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,588
I mean- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

148
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,759
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

149
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,055
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

150
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,558
Oh, um...

151
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,396
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

152
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,946
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

153
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,533
- Errol.
He's always doing that.

154
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,122
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

155
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,334
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

156
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,461
 Oh, no.
- This lot won't come cheap.

157
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,965
- The spell books alone are expensive.
We'll manage.

158
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,970
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

159
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,598
Right.

160
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,850
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

161
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,978
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

162
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,188
Floo powder?

163
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:20,651
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

164
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,153
In you go.

165
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
That's it.

166
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,452
Diagon Alley.

167
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,962
You see? lt's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

168
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,965
Come on.

169
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,301
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

170
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,888
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

171
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,892
That's it, very good.

172
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:58,397
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

173
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,651
Diagonally.

174
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,493
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

175
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,744
I thought he did.

176
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:44,086
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- l'm fine, thank you. l was just going...

177
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,757
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

178
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,593
- No. Please-
Harry?

179
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,844
Hagrid!

180
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,014
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

181
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:07,109
 You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

182
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,279
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

183
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,657
I was lost, I-

184
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,785
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

185
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:22,124
Me? l was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

186
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,168
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

187
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,801
Harry. Hagrid.

188
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,386
Hello, Hermione.

189
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,389
- lt's so good to see you.
- lt's great to see you too.

190
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,642
What did you do to your glasses?

191
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,687
Oculus Reparo.

192
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,901
I definitely need to remember that one.

193
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,822
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

194
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,407
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

195
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,576
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

196
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,421

Oh, Harry.

197
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,841
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

198
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,844
 Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

199
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,305
Here he is.

200
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,894
Mum fancies him.

201
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,355
 Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

202
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,942
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

203
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,033
It can't be. Harry Potter?

204
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,411

Harry Potter!

205
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,829
Excuse me, madam.

206
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,627
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and l rate the front page.

207
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,963
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

208
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,550
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

209
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,846
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

210
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,228
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

211
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:11,233
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

212
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,904
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

213
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,952
...with my entire collected works...

214
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,746
...free of charge.

215
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,167
Now, ladies?

216
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,504
Harry, now you give me those,
and l'll get them signed.

217
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,174
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

218
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,978
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

219
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,649
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

220
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,985
Leave him alone.

221
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,655
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

222
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,909
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

223
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,494
Mr. Potter.

224
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,959
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

225
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,295
Forgive me.

226
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,715
Your scar is legend.

227
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,509
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

228
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,012
Voldemort killed my parents.

229
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,559
He was nothing more than a murderer.

230
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,521
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

231
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,523
Or very foolish.

232
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,485
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

233
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,365
And you must be Miss Granger.

234
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,497
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

235
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,589
Muggles, aren't they?

236
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:05,680
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

237
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,393
...tatty, secondhand book.

238
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,980
You must be the Weasleys.

239
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,399
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

240
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,278
LUClUS: Well, Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

241
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,200
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

242
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,702
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

243
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,039
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

244
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,544
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

245
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,797
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

246
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,094
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

247
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,137
Clearly.

248
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,935
Associating with Muggles.

249
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,735
And l thought your family
could sink no lower.

250
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,825
I'll see you at work.

251
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,331
See you at school.

252
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,424

10:58, come on.

253
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,842

The train will leave soon.

254
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,303
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

255
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,561
Okay.

256
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,318

After you, dear.

257
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,699
 Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

258
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,119
Let's go.

259
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,178
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

260
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,639
Lost control of the trolley.

261
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,310
- Why can't we get through?
- l don't know.

262
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,813
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

263
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:24,152
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

264
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,655
Harry, if we can't get through...

265
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,658
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

266
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,038
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

267
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,415
The car.

268
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,096
Ron, I should tell you...

269
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,058
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

270
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,351
Right.

271
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,685
Okay.

272
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,248
Oh, no! The lnvisibility Booster
must be faulty.

273
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,876
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

274
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,294
Okay.

275
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,266
 All we need to do
is catch up with the train.

276
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,101
We can't be far behind.

277
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,814
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

278
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,400
Hold on.

279
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,845
Harry!

280
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,308
Hold on!

281
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,147
Take my hand!

282
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,652
Hold on!

283
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,448
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

284
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,297
- l think we found the train.
- Yeah.

285
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,273
Welcome home.

286
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,582
Up! Up!

287
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,710
It's not working!

288
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,217
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

289
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,597
Stop! Stop! Stop!

290
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:07,375
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

291
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,963
- What's happening?
- l don't know.

292
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,584

Come on, go! Fast!

293
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,704
Scabbers, you're okay.

294
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,291
The car!

295
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,558
Dad's gonna kill me.

296
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,486

See you, Hedwig.

297
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,156
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

298
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,243
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

299
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,663
...we almost get killed by a tree...

300
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:12,375
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

301
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,923
Well, take a good look, lads.

302
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:23,010
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

303
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:29,350
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

304
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:35,773
 You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

305
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,026
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

306
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,531
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

307
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,118
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

308
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,496
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

309
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,500
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

310
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,793
Silence.

311
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:04,218
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

312
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,139
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

313
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,559
- As it is-
They are not.

314
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,815
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

315
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,734
Headmaster...

316
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:24,655
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

317
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,743
- As such-
- l am well aware of our bylaws...

318
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,787
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

319
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,416
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

320
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:40,588
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

321
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,174
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

322
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,801
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

323
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,179
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

324
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,850
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

325
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,064
...but l must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

326
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:03,194
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

327
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,096
Morning, everyone.

328
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,307
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

329
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,728
 Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

330
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,731
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

331
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,902
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

332
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,904
Yes, Miss Granger?

333
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,407
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

334
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:54,579
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

335
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:59,750
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

336
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,753
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

337
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,631
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

338
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,675
...their cries won't kill you yet.

339
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,679
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

340
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,347
...for auditory protection.

341
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,935
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

342
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,896
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

343
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,066
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

344
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,236
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

345
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,409
Got it? And...

346
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,745
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

347
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,666
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

348
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,465
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

349
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,927
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

350
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,890
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

351
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,602
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

352
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,329
 There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

353
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,082

Hello, Sir Nicholas.

354
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,805
Say it. I'm doomed.

355
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,599
- You're doomed.
Hi, Harry.

356
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,521
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

357
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,314
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

358
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,733
Ron, is that your owl?

359
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,126
Bloody bird's a menace.

360
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,798
Oh, no.

361
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,468
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

362
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:21,142
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. lt was horrible.

363
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,192

Ronald Weasley!

364
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:38,909
How dare you steal that car!
l am absolutely disgusted!

365
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,829
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

366
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,331
...and it's entirely your fault!

367
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,669
lf you put another toe out of line...

368
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:52,089
...we'll bring you straight home!

369
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,385
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

370
00:34:56,553 --> 00:35:00,306
Your father and l are so proud.

371
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:24,955
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

372
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,707
Me.

373
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,376
Gilderoy Lockhart...

374
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,880
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

375
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,383
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

376
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,428
...and five times winner...

377
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:45,643
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

378
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,561
But l don't talk about that.

379
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:52,233
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

380
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,864
Now, be warned.

381
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,158
It is my job to arm you...

382
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:06,664
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

383
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,085
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

384
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:15,297
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst l am here.

385
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,425
I must ask you not to scream.

386
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,136
It might provoke them.

387
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,141
Cornish pixies?

388
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,395

Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

389
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,273
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

390
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,610
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

391
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,697
Let's see what you make of them.

392
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,288
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

393
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,182
PlXlE: You just stay there!
Please, get me down!

394
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,979
HERMlONE: Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

395
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,817
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

396
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,091
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

397
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,012
What do we do now?

398
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,015
lmmobulus!

399
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,735
Why is it always me?

400
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,786
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

401
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,623
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

402
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,085
What-? l don't believe it.

403
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,590
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

404
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:26,136
- l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. l've got a note.

405
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,765
Uh-oh. l smell trouble.

406
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,894
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

407
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,564
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

408
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,401
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

409
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,991
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

410
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,952
And that's not all
that's new this year.

411
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,248
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

412
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,458
A gift from Draco's father.

413
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,421
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

414
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,590
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

415
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,635
They got in on pure talent.

416
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,767
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

417
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,690
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

418
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,116
You okay, Ron?

419
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,954
Say something.

420
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,673
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
No, Colin, get out of the way.

421
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,634
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

422
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,970
He'll know what to do.

423
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,191
 This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

424
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,531
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

425
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,368
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

426
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:19,333
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

427
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,921
Well, l don't know
exactly what it means.

428
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,094
He called me a Mudblood.

429
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,930
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

430
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:37,851
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

431
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,272
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

432
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,902
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

433
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:52,866
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

434
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:57,704
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

435
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,540
That's horrible.

436
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,877
It's disgusting.

437
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,548
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

438
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,051
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

439
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,764
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

440
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,183
Come here.

441
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:25,732
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

442
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,609
Aye?

443
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,577

Harry, Harry, Harry.

444
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,954
Can you possibly imagine...

445
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,332
...a better way to serve detention...

446
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,669
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

447
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,254
Not really.

448
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:53,802
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

449
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,929
Remember that.

450
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,810

Come.

451
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,104
Come...

452
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,275
...to me.

453
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,114
- What?
- Sorry?

454
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,285
That voice.

455
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,995
Voice?

456
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:28,170
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

457
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,382
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

458
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,637
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

459
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,307
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

460
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,814
Spooky.

461
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,986

Blood.

462
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,698
l smell blood.

463
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,993
Let me rip you.

464
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:03,705
Let me kill you.

465
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,294
Kill!

466
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,880
- Kill!
- Harry!

467
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,549
 Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

468
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,178
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

469
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:22,307
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just-

470
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,685
lt's time.

471
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,021
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

472
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,943
 Kill?
HERMlONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

473
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,595
Strange.

474
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:05,600
- l've never seen spiders act like that.
- l don't like spiders.

475
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,773
What's that?

476
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,738
HERMlONE: "The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened.

477
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,781
Enemies of the Heir, beware."

478
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,242
It's written in blood.

479
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,289
Oh, no.

480
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,296
It's Filch's cat.

481
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,090
It's Mrs. Norris.

482
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,901
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

483
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,780
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

484
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:05,118
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

485
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,372
Potter?

486
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,665
What are you...?

487
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,296
Mrs. Norris?

488
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,968
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

489
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,637

I'll kill you.

490
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,809
- l'll kill you!
Argus!

491
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,354
Argus, l...

492
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:38,985
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

493
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,696
Everyone except...

494
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,699
...you three.

495
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,579

Ravenclaws, follow me.

496
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:55,335
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

497
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,338
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

498
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,716
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

499
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,680
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

500
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,683
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

501
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,519
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

502
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:16,773
It's not true, sir. l swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

503
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:21,403
- Rubbish.
- lf I might, headmaster?

504
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:26,700
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

505
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,077
However...

506
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,372
...the circumstances are suspicious.

507
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,210
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

508
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,588

I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

509
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,216
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

510
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:46,636
HERMlONE: That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

511
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,556
We'd just found him when he said...

512
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,645
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When l said l wasn't hungry.

513
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:01,067
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

514
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:08,909
- lnnocent until proven guilty, Severus.
My cat has been Petrified.

515
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:15,582
- l want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

516
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:21,296
As l understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

517
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:25,926
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

518
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,928
And in the meantime...

519
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,474
...l strongly recommend caution...

520
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,143
...to all.

521
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,616
HERMlONE: lt's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

522
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,536
HERMlONE: You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

523
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:57,457
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. lt's just strange.

524
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,835
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

525
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,462
Are you mad?

526
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:08,134
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

527
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,639
MAN lN PlCTURE:
She's right, you know.

528
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,312
 Could I have
your attention, please?

529
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:25,318
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

530
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,862
...into water goblets.

531
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,490
Like so.

532
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:35,537
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.

533
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:43,003
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

534
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:48,550
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."

535
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,222
Vera Verto!

536
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,023
 That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

537
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,526
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

538
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:10,905
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

539
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,371
Very well.

540
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,875
You all know, of course...

541
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:25,879
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

542
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:30,467
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

543
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:34,387
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

544
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:40,226
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

545
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:46,900
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

546
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,070
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

547
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,239
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

548
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,576
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

549
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:01,331
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

550
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,625
In other words, pure-bloods.

551
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:09,339
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

552
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,425
Now, according to legend...

553
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:16,304
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

554
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:20,141
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

555
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,771
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

556
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:29,025
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

557
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,611
The Heir alone...

558
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,447
...would be able to open the Chamber...

559
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:39,327
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

560
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:42,872
...purge the school
of all those who...

561
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,044
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

562
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,797
Muggle-borns.

563
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:55,468
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

564
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:59,139
No such chamber has been found.

565
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:04,352
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

566
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,814
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

567
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,526
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

568
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,822
It is said to be the home...

569
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,574
...of a monster.

570
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,000
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

571
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:31,379
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

572
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,383
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means-

573
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,512
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

574
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,058
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

575
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,895
- lf you're talking about Malfoy-
- Of course. You heard him.

576
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,772
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

577
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,566
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

578
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,903
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

579
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,864
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

580
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,451
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

581
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:06,080
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

582
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,082
Mind you, it would be difficult.

583
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,294
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

584
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:15,924
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

585
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,225
HERMlONE:
Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

586
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,102
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

587
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,565
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

588
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,486
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

589
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,073
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

590
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:44,077
But it's tricky. l've never seen
a more complicated potion.

591
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:47,372
 How long will it take to make?
- A month.

592
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,165
A month?

593
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,169
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

594
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,589
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

595
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,633
I know.

596
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,636
But it's the only plan we've got.

597
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,022
Another goal for Slytherin!

598
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,735
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

599
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,531
Yeah!

600
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,099
All right there, Scarhead?

601
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,733
Watch yourself, Harry!

602
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,902

Wood, look out!

603
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,418
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

604
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,379
That's been tampered with, that has.

605
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,422
I'll stop it.

606
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,219
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

607
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,830
Training for the ballet, Potter?

608
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,071
You'll never catch me, Potter.

609
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,913
Let's go.

610
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:44,293
 Harry Potter has caught
the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!

611
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,677
Finite lncantatem!

612
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,060
- Thank you.
HERMlONE: Are you okay?

613
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,312
No. I think my arm is broken.

614
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,982
Not to worry. l will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

615
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:10,403
- No. Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

616
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:14,115
This won't hurt a bit.

617
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,249
Brackium Emendo!

618
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,343
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

619
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,762
...but the point is...

620
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,268
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

621
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,104
Broken? There's no bones left.

622
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,774

Much more flexible, though.

623
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:55,156
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

624
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,283
Should have been brought
straight to me.

625
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,994
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

626
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,662
You will be able to, won't you?

627
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,957
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

628
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:10,296
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

629
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,177
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

630
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,560

Kill.

631
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,979
Kill.

632
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,529
Time to kill.

633
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:42,703
Hello.

634
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,539
Dobby?

635
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,042
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

636
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,213
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

637
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:57,009
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

638
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,304
Indeed. Yes, sir.

639
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:06,352
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

640
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,188
Harry Potter must go home.

641
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:12,900
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see-

642
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:16,445
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

643
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,199
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

644
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:24,036
Dobby had to iron his hands.

645
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:30,835
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or l might strangle you.

646
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,423
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

647
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,634
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

648
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,595
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

649
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,766
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

650
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:49,270
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

651
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,565
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

652
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:56,444
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

653
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:02,074
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

654
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:14,003
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

655
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:19,300
This, sir? lt is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

656
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:23,929
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

657
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,100
Listen.

658
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,810
Listen!

659
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,689
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

660
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,776
Harry Potter must not stay here...

661
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:41,489
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

662
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,117
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

663
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,286
I shouldn't have said that.

664
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:54,168
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

665
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,003
Stop it, Dobby!

666
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:01,509
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

667
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:06,889
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

668
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,350
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

669
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:22,947

Put him here.

670
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,536
What happened?

671
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,496

There's been another attack.

672
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:36,377
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

673
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:41,882
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

674
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,726

What can this mean, Albus?

675
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,854
It means...

676
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,023
...that our students
are in great danger.

677
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,569
- What should I tell the staff?
The truth.

678
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,614
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

679
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:08,909
It is as we feared, Minerva.

680
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:13,706
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

681
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:20,713
HERMlONE: You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

682
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,591
Of course.
Don't you see?

683
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,760
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

684
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,972
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

685
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,309
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

686
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,438
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

687
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:41,567
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

688
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:45,112
No. No one ever comes in here.

689
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,532
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

690
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,201
Who?

691
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,786
Moaning Myrtle.

692
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,415
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- l'm Moaning Myrtle.

693
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,757
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

694
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,927
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

695
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,472
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

696
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,814
She's a little sensitive.

697
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,279

Gather round!

698
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:32,618
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

699
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,955
Can you all hear me?

700
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,957
Excellent.

701
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:42,127
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

702
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:46,966
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

703
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:51,804
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

704
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,640
...as l myself have done
on countless occasions.

705
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:58,477
For full details,
see my published works.

706
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:06,318
Let me introduce my assistant...

707
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,154
...Professor Snape.

708
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:15,244
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

709
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,496
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

710
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:22,543
You'll still have your Potions master
when l'm through with him. Never fear.

711
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,852
One.

712
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,020
Two.

713
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,857
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!

714
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,118
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

715
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,246
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

716
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,959
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

717
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:07,379
If l had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

718
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:11,050
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

719
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:15,721
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

720
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,892
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

721
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:25,397
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

722
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:29,068
 Weasley's wand causes
devastation with the simplest spells.

723
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:33,155
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

724
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:37,409
Might l suggest someone
from my own house?

725
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,205
Malfoy, perhaps?

726
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,215
 Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

727
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,141

Wands at the ready.

728
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,770
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

729
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,865

On the count of three...

730
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:21,370
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

731
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:25,124
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

732
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,461
- Two.
- Everte Statum!

733
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,308
Rictusempra!

734
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,071
I said disarm only.

735
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,282
Serpensortia!

736
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,710
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

737
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:15,340
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

738
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,552
Vipera Evanesca.

739
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,603
What are you playing at?

740
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,077
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

741
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,496
- l'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

742
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:33,001
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

743
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:37,130
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

744
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,093
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

745
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,262
This is bad.

746
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:47,182
What's bad? If l hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin-

747
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,811
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

748
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:54,857
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

749
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,943
I spoke a different language?

750
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:01,363
But l didn't realize-

751
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,324
How can l speak a language
without knowing I can?

752
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:08,495
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

753
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,414
Harry, listen to me.

754
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,667
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

755
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:18,338
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

756
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,631
Exactly.

757
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,176
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

758
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,345
But l'm not.

759
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,017
I can't be.

760
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,186
HERMlONE:
He lived a thousand years ago.

761
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:36,565
For all we know, you could be.

762
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,056
I'll see you back in the common room.

763
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,743

l want blood.

764
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:37,626
They all must die.

765
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:46,051
Kill.

766
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:50,430
Time to kill.

767
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,591
Caught in the act.

768
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,677
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

769
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,680
Mark my words.

770
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:36,101
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand-

771
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,796
Professor...

772
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,339
...l swear I didn't.

773
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:09,801
This is out of my hands, Potter.

774
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,105
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

775
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,617
Sherbet Lemon.

776
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,694
Professor Dumbledore?

777
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,880
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

778
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,263
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

779
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:41,893
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

780
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,605
But l stand by what l said last year.

781
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:49,151
You would have done well in Slytherin.

782
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,694
You're wrong.

783
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,349

Harry?

784
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,977
Professor.

785
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,939
Your bird...
There was nothing l could do.

786
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,860
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

787
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,030
He's been looking dreadful for days.

788
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,240
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

789
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:42,370
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

790
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,874
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

791
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,168
...and then they are...

792
01:15:48,336 --> 01:15:51,379
...reborn from the ashes.

793
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,390
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

794
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,728
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

795
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,773
Their tears have healing powers.

796
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,403
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

797
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,531
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

798
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:21,660
- Hagrid-
- l'd swear it in front of the Ministry.

799
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,662
Hagrid.

800
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,914
Relax.

801
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,667
I do not believe...

802
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:33,296
- ...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

803
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,882
Oh.

804
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,677
Right. Well, I'll...

805
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,930
- l'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

806
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,271
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

807
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,940
I do not think it was you.

808
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,818
But l must ask you...

809
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:59,447
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

810
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,872
No, sir.

811
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,541
Nothing.

812
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,713
Very well, then.

813
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,631
Off you go.

814
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:58,131
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

815
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,008
Crabbe and Goyle.

816
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,969
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

817
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,389
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

818
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,434
- How?
- l've got it all worked out.

819
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,145
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

820
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,106
Simple, but powerful.

821
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,442
Now, once they're asleep...

822
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,820
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

823
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,864
...and put on their uniforms.

824
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,326
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- l've already got mine.

825
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:29,662
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

826
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,998
I got this off her robes.

827
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,793
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

828
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,670
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

829
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:52,185
Ron, maybe l should do it.

830
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,437
Yeah. Right.

831
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,483
Wingardium Leviosa.

832
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,203
Cool.

833
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,186
How thick could you get?

834
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,355
Come on, let's get them.

835
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:44,028
HERMlONE: We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

836
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,122
Add the hairs.

837
01:19:57,585 --> 01:20:00,420
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe.

838
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,505
HERMlONE:
Cheers.

839
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,600
I think I'm gonna be sick.

840
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,396
Me too.

841
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,984
Harry?

842
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,986
Ron.

843
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,948
Bloody hell!

844
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,992
We still sound like ourselves.

845
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,953
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

846
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,373
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

847
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,209
- But where's Hermione?
HERMlONE: l...

848
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,379
I don't think l'm going.
You go on without me.

849
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,297
Hermione, are you okay?

850
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:29,300
HERMlONE:
Just go. You're wasting time.

851
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,012
Come on.

852
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:40,395
- The Slytherin common room's this way.
- Okay.

853
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:45,316

Excuse me.

854
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,028
What are you doing d-?

855
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,322
I mean, what are you doing down here?

856
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,910
I happen to be a school prefect.

857
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:00,540
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

858
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,001
What are your names again?

859
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:07,171
- l'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

860
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,341
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

861
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,178
Why are you wearing glasses?

862
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,849
- Reading.
- Reading?

863
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,269
I didn't know you could read.

864
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,232
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

865
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,443
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

866
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,245
Well, sit down.

867
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:45,877
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

868
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,922
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

869
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:53,051
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

870
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,055
Stomachache.

871
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:03,895
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

872
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:06,481
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

873
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,150
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

874
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:13,112
- ...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

875
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,788
What?

876
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,625
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

877
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:28,252
Well? Do you?

878
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,630
Harry Potter?

879
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,596
Good one, Goyle.

880
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,306
You're absolutely right.

881
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,809
Saint Potter.

882
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:46,604
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

883
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,985
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

884
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:56,823
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

885
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,326
How many times do l have to tell you?

886
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,162
Is this yours?

887
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,002
But my father did say this:

888
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:13,297
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

889
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,844
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

890
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:22,807
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

891
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:27,311
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

892
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,689
As for me...

893
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,024
...l hope it's Granger.

894
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:34,402
What's the matter with you two?

895
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,071
You're acting very odd.

896
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,490
It's his stomachache.

897
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,701
Calm down.

898
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,874
Scar.

899
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,879
Hair.

900
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,429
Hey! Where are you going?

901
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,725
That was close.

902
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:08,352
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

903
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,354
HERMlONE:
Go away.

904
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:14,734
Wait till you see. It's awful.

905
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,446
Hermione?

906
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,239
Are you okay?

907
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,076
HERMlONE:
Do you remember me telling you...

908
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,413
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

909
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:31,709
It was cat hair l plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

910
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,630
Look at my face.

911
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:39,217
Look at your tail.

912
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:47,225

Have you spoken to Hermione?

913
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,936
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

914
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,939
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

915
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,445
What's this?

916
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,117

Yuck!

917
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:08,079
 Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

918
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:28,432
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would l throw something at you?

919
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:32,937
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

920
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:36,774
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

921
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,819
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

922
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:42,446
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

923
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:47,827
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

924
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:50,621
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

925
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:54,292
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

926
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:59,213
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- l don't know. I didn't see them.

927
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:03,801
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

928
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:07,680
...and it fell through the top
of my head. Uh-huh.

929
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,338

"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

930
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,536
My name...

931
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:15,623
...is Harry...

932
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,377
...Potter.

933
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:37,770
Do you know anything...

934
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:44,694
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

935
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,331
Can you...

936
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,918
...tell me?

937
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:06,609
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

938
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:12,364
Are you Tom Riddle?

939
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,325
Hello, can you hear me?

940
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:36,680

Riddle!

941
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:38,766
Come.

942
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,935
Professor Dumbledore.

943
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,272
Dumbledore?

944
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:50,069
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

945
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:53,572

Yes, professor. l suppose l...

946
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,908
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

947
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,411
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

948
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:02,414
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

949
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:05,417
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

950
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:08,170
I understand, Tom, but l'm afraid...

951
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,882
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

952
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,554
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

953
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,891
Is there something...

954
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,811
...you wish to tell me?

955
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,565
No, sir. Nothing.

956
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,408
Very well, then. Off you go.

957
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,410
Good night, sir.

958
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,449
 Let's get you out of there.
Evening, Hagrid.

959
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:23,120
I'm going to have to turn you in. l don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

960
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,623
You can't. You don't understand.

961
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,959
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

962
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:32,004
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

963
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:35,382
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

964
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:37,885
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

965
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,678
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

966
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,805
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

967
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,641
Cistem Aperio!

968
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,900
Arania Exumai!

969
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,236

Aragog!

970
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,654
Aragog!

971
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:58,572

I can't let you go.

972
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:02,409
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

973
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:16,423
Hagrid!

974
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,187
Whoa.

975
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:41,031
 lt was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

976
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:44,118
HERMlONE: lt can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

977
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,372
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

978
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:52,042
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

979
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:56,338
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

980
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,216
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

981
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:03,220
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

982
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,557
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

983
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:07,891
No.

984
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:14,064
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

985
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:19,069
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

986
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:22,906
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

987
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:26,577
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

988
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:29,997
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

989
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:34,335
In the meantime, though, you three...

990
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,671
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

991
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,300
Hm.

992
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,473
Hello, Neville.

993
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,101
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

994
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,145
Come on!

995
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,713
HERMlONE: lt had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

996
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:22,132
Unless it wasn't a student.

997
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,719
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

998
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,304

And they found it.

999
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,557
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1000
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:33,477

All right, listen up.

1001
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,522
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1002
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,565
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1003
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,735
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1004
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:45,447
- ...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

1005
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:48,158
Professor McGonagall.

1006
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:51,370
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1007
01:35:51,538 --> 01:35:56,500
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1008
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:59,336
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.

1009
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:02,256
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1010
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:07,970
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1011
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:17,521
Hermione!

1012
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,566

She was found near the library...

1013
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,776
...along with this.

1014
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:27,072
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1015
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,699
No.

1016
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,257

Could l have your attention, please?

1017
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:51,054
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1018
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:56,560
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1019
01:36:56,728 --> 01:37:00,772
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1020
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:03,942
No exceptions."

1021
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:06,653
I should tell you this:

1022
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:10,949
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1023
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:14,661
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1024
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:29,134
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1025
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,595
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1026
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:34,932
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1027
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,350
But you heard McGonagall.

1028
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:39,811
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1029
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,773
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1030
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,121
Who's there?

1031
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:05,629
Hello?

1032
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:11,134
- What's that for?
- Nothing. l was expecting, uh...

1033
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:15,138
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1034
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,185
Hagrid, are you okay?

1035
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:23,230
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1036
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,899
Did you hear about Hermione?

1037
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:30,112
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1038
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:34,116
Look, we have to ask you something.

1039
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:39,246
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1040
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,500
What you had to understand
about that is-

1041
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,170
Quick, under the cloak.

1042
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:50,882
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1043
01:38:57,348 --> 01:39:00,392
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1044
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,020
I wonder, could we...?

1045
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:05,689
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1046
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:07,190
That's Dad's boss.

1047
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,944
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1048
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:15,532
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1049
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,910
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1050
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:22,289
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But l never-

1051
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,291
You know I never, professor.

1052
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:27,544
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1053
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,546
...that Hagrid...

1054
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:32,049
...has my full confidence.

1055
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:35,969
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1056
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:38,722
- l've got to take him.
Take me?

1057
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,183
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1058
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:45,228

I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1059
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:47,731
Already here, Fudge?

1060
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,232
Good.

1061
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:52,903
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1062
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,113
LUClUS:
Believe me...

1063
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:59,618
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1064
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,747
You call this a house?

1065
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:05,832
No.

1066
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,920
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1067
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:14,132
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1068
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:19,429
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1069
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,975
This is an order of suspension.

1070
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:32,943
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1071
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:40,992
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1072
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:44,037
Well, what with all these attacks...

1073
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:46,998
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1074
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:51,712
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1075
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,131
 You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1076
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,967
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1077
01:40:57,135 --> 01:40:59,553
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1078
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,388
You think so?

1079
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:04,057

Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1080
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:08,145
If the governors desire my removal...

1081
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:12,023
...l will, of course, step aside.

1082
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,861
However...

1083
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:21,074
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1084
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:23,160
...to those who...

1085
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,662
...ask for it.

1086
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,755
Admirable sentiments.

1087
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:36,798
Shall we?

1088
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:50,395
Fudge.

1089
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,940
Come, Hagrid.

1090
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:56,610
Well?

1091
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,361

If...

1092
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,364
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1093
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:06,369
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1094
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,122
Yep. That would lead them right.

1095
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:11,249
That's all l have to say.

1096
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,713
Oh, and someone will need
to feed Fang while l'm away.

1097
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:22,093

Good boy.

1098
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,393
Hagrid's right.

1099
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,480
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1100
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:35,357
Look.

1101
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,156
Come on.

1102
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:48,912
Come on, Fang.

1103
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,598
Come on.

1104
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,016

What?

1105
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,436
 You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1106
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:16,273
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1107
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:22,779
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1108
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:01,318

Harry, I don't like this.

1109
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:09,659
- Harry, l don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1110
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:23,673
Can we go back now?

1111
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:25,592
Come on.

1112
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:18,061

Who is it?

1113
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:19,896
Don't panic.

1114
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:21,731

Hagrid?

1115
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:23,733
Is that you?

1116
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:26,236
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1117
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:47,549
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1118
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:49,426

Yes.

1119
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:53,430
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1120
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:56,683
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1121
01:45:57,309 --> 01:45:59,144
They think it's Hagrid.

1122
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,939
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1123
01:46:03,149 --> 01:46:05,483

That's a lie.

1124
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,862
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1125
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,365
- Then you're not the monster?
No.

1126
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:15,618
The monster was born in the castle.

1127
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:21,124
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1128
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:24,586
- Harry.
- Shush.

1129
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:29,841
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1130
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:33,011

We do not speak of it.

1131
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:38,892
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1132
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:40,852
But have you seen it?

1133
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,358
 l never saw any part of the
castle but the box in which I was kept.

1134
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:50,695
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1135
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:55,366
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1136
01:46:55,534 --> 01:46:57,535
- Harry!
- What?

1137
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:13,384
Well, thank you.

1138
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:16,513
We'll just go.

1139
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,723

Go?

1140
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,725
I think not.

1141
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:26,356
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1142
01:47:26,524 --> 01:47:28,942
But l cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1143
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:33,446
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1144
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:37,408
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1145
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,410
Can we panic now?

1146
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:52,048
Know any spells?

1147
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:55,385
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1148
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:58,304
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1149
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:13,111
Let's go!

1150
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,326

Arania Exumai!

1151
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:26,958
Go!

1152
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,262
Whoa!

1153
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:47,020
Glad we're out of there.

1154
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,321
Arania Exumai!

1155
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:05,788
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1156
01:49:16,759 --> 01:49:18,885

Get us out of here.

1157
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:21,054
Now!

1158
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:27,393
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1159
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,397
Come on! Go!

1160
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:51,000
Get us in the air.

1161
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:53,503
The flying gear's jammed!

1162
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:01,386
 Come on! Pull!
- l'm trying!

1163
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:33,626
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1164
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:38,131
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1165
01:50:52,146 --> 01:50:55,398
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1166
01:50:55,566 --> 01:51:00,153
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1167
01:51:00,362 --> 01:51:03,740
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1168
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,908
He was innocent.

1169
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,885
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1170
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:26,679
We need you.

1171
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:29,682
Now more than ever.

1172
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:50,036
- What's that?
- Ron...

1173
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:55,333
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1174
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:57,126
Come on.

1175
01:51:57,795 --> 01:52:00,797
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1176
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:05,551
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1177
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:09,514
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1178
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:12,683
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1179
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:15,645
The monster in the
Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.

1180
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:19,732
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1181
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:25,363
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1182
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,960
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1183
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:43,506
Not directly, at least.

1184
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:46,926
Colin saw it through his camera.

1185
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:51,180
Justin- Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1186
01:52:51,348 --> 01:52:55,351
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1187
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:58,604
And Hermione had the mirror.

1188
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:02,191
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1189
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:03,609
And Mrs. Norris?

1190
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:07,280
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1191
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:10,700
The water.

1192
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:16,747
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1193
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,797
"Spiders flee before it."

1194
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:28,718
- lt all fits.
- How's the basilisk been getting around?

1195
01:53:28,886 --> 01:53:31,721
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1196
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:37,560
 Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.

1197
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:41,981
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1198
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:46,402
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1199
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,404
Moaning Myrtle.

1200
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:53,409
 All students are to
return to their dormitories at once.

1201
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:57,038
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1202
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:07,840
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1203
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:10,259
Our worst fear has been realized.

1204
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:14,972
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1205
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:21,687
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1206
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,526
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have l missed?

1207
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:31,030
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1208
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:34,158
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1209
01:54:34,326 --> 01:54:38,871
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1210
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:45,711
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1211
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:51,050
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1212
01:54:51,218 --> 01:54:54,470
I'll just be in my office getting...

1213
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:57,223
Getting ready.

1214
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,354
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1215
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:05,356
Ginny Weasley.

1216
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:19,829
 "Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1217
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:25,668
Ginny.

1218
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:31,257
 Lockhart's useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1219
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,176
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1220
01:55:35,512 --> 01:55:38,055
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1221
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:41,767
Are you going somewhere?

1222
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:45,062
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1223
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:48,441
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1224
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:52,278
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1225
01:55:52,446 --> 01:55:56,449
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1226
01:55:56,658 --> 01:55:59,619
I must say, when l took the job,
there was nothing in the description-

1227
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:00,953
You're running away?

1228
01:56:01,163 --> 01:56:03,914
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1229
01:56:04,082 --> 01:56:06,626
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1230
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:11,213
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1231
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,382
You're a fraud.

1232
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:16,385
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1233
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:18,471
Is there anything you can do?

1234
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:23,392
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1235
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,062
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1236
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:29,315
I'd never have sold another book.

1237
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:35,237
In fact, l'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1238
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:38,491
Don't even think about it.

1239
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:50,795

Who's there?

1240
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:55,257
Hello, Harry.

1241
01:56:56,218 --> 01:57:01,347
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1242
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:06,185
It was dreadful.

1243
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:10,022
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1244
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:14,276
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1245
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:19,323
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1246
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:25,830
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- l don't know. I was distraught!

1247
01:57:27,124 --> 01:57:30,543
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1248
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:37,049
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1249
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:43,055
- ...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1250
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:47,727
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1251
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:51,772
...over there by that sink.

1252
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,883
This is it.

1253
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:24,597
This is it, Ron. l think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1254
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:31,437
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1255
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:27,076
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, l'll just be...

1256
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:29,495
There's no need for me to stay.

1257
01:59:30,121 --> 01:59:31,997

Yes, there is.

1258
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,919
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1259
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:38,420
Better you than us.

1260
01:59:39,631 --> 01:59:42,591
But- Obviously, yes.

1261
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:49,598
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1262
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:59,608

It's really quite filthy down here.

1263
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:04,613
- All right. Let's go.
Oh, Harry?

1264
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:09,952
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1265
02:00:12,497 --> 02:00:14,456
Thanks, Myrtle.

1266
02:00:39,649 --> 02:00:41,483

Ugh.

1267
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:48,741
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1268
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,368

Go on.

1269
02:00:55,081 --> 02:00:56,457

This way.

1270
02:01:03,465 --> 02:01:08,677
 What's this?
- lt looks like a snake.

1271
02:01:08,845 --> 02:01:12,514
 lt's a snakeskin.
Bloody hell.

1272
02:01:12,682 --> 02:01:18,520
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1273
02:01:20,398 --> 02:01:23,359
Heart of a lion, this one.

1274
02:01:27,072 --> 02:01:31,742
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1275
02:01:33,703 --> 02:01:39,124
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1276
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:42,962
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1277
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:46,131
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1278
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,425
So...

1279
02:01:49,552 --> 02:01:51,887
You first, Mr. Potter.

1280
02:01:52,138 --> 02:01:55,307
Say goodbye to your memories.

1281
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,311
obliviate!

1282
02:02:26,047 --> 02:02:31,051
Harry.

1283
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:36,348
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- l'm fine.

1284
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:41,854
Hello.

1285
02:02:42,564 --> 02:02:44,356
Who are you?

1286
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:48,444
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1287
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:51,447
And who am l?

1288
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:57,578
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1289
02:02:57,871 --> 02:03:02,374
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1290
02:03:02,584 --> 02:03:04,668
Do you live here?

1291
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:07,880
- No.
- Really?

1292
02:03:12,469 --> 02:03:14,303
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1293
02:03:14,471 --> 02:03:17,389
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1294
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:21,226
- l'll go on and find Ginny.
Okay.

1295
02:04:45,061 --> 02:04:46,895
Ginny.

1296
02:04:54,445 --> 02:04:58,323
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1297
02:04:58,825 --> 02:05:00,909
Please wake up.

1298
02:05:01,202 --> 02:05:03,328
She won't wake.

1299
02:05:08,793 --> 02:05:13,130
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1300
02:05:13,298 --> 02:05:16,717
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1301
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:19,970
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1302
02:05:20,138 --> 02:05:22,514
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1303
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:30,439
 She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1304
02:05:30,607 --> 02:05:32,983
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1305
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:35,777
It won't come until it's called.

1306
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:41,366
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1307
02:05:42,452 --> 02:05:45,829
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- l'm afraid l can't do that.

1308
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:50,042
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1309
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:55,881
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1310
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:58,383

No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1311
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:01,803
 Ginny set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1312
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:04,389
...Ginny wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1313
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:07,851
 But why?
Because I told her to.

1314
02:06:08,019 --> 02:06:12,981
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1315
02:06:13,149 --> 02:06:16,485
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1316
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:19,529
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1317
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:22,074
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1318
02:06:22,283 --> 02:06:26,578
And then who should find it but you?

1319
02:06:26,788 --> 02:06:29,873
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1320
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,542
And why did you want to meet me?

1321
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:36,338
I knew l had to talk to you,
meet you if l could.

1322
02:06:36,506 --> 02:06:39,758
So l decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1323
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:43,095
- ...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1324
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:48,600
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- lt was my word against Hagrid's.

1325
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:52,062
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1326
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:54,398
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1327
02:06:54,565 --> 02:06:58,026
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1328
02:06:58,194 --> 02:07:01,530
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while l was at school...

1329
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,532
...so l decided to leave behind
a diary...

1330
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,784
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1331
02:07:05,952 --> 02:07:08,620
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1332
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:11,623
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1333
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:14,042
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1334
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:17,212
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1335
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:20,090
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1336
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:25,721
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1337
02:07:25,972 --> 02:07:30,767
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1338
02:07:32,228 --> 02:07:35,856
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1339
02:07:36,024 --> 02:07:38,650
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1340
02:07:38,985 --> 02:07:41,945
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1341
02:07:42,113 --> 02:07:44,489
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1342
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:48,869
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1343
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:55,500
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1344
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:19,399
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1345
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:26,114
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1346
02:08:26,282 --> 02:08:30,786
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1347
02:08:30,953 --> 02:08:35,123
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name l knew wizards everywhere...

1348
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:39,503
...would fear to speak when l became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1349
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:42,839
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1350
02:08:43,007 --> 02:08:46,426
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1351
02:08:46,636 --> 02:08:51,640
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1352
02:08:58,022 --> 02:08:59,064
Fawkes?

1353
02:09:15,331 --> 02:09:18,917
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1354
02:09:19,085 --> 02:09:22,754
A songbird and an old hat.

1355
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:40,605
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1356
02:09:40,773 --> 02:09:44,776
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1357
02:09:58,124 --> 02:10:02,502
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. lt only obeys me.

1358
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:34,242

No!

1359
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:39,164
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1360
02:12:21,183 --> 02:12:24,436
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1361
02:12:24,645 --> 02:12:29,524
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1362
02:12:29,692 --> 02:12:32,360
Lord Voldemort will return...

1363
02:12:32,737 --> 02:12:36,948
...very much alive.

1364
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:39,075
Ginny?

1365
02:14:55,421 --> 02:14:57,005

Remarkable, isn't it...

1366
02:14:57,173 --> 02:15:01,176
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1367
02:15:01,343 --> 02:15:04,012
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1368
02:15:04,346 --> 02:15:08,391
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1369
02:15:13,397 --> 02:15:17,066
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1370
02:15:17,234 --> 02:15:22,322
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1371
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:26,951
What are you doing?

1372
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:31,915
Stop. No!

1373
02:16:24,593 --> 02:16:26,511
Ginny.

1374
02:16:28,264 --> 02:16:30,014
Harry.

1375
02:16:30,182 --> 02:16:34,185
It was me.
But l swear, l didn't mean to.

1376
02:16:34,395 --> 02:16:37,897
Riddle made me, and...

1377
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:41,025
Harry, you're hurt.

1378
02:16:41,402 --> 02:16:42,861
Don't worry.

1379
02:16:43,028 --> 02:16:46,698
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1380
02:16:46,907 --> 02:16:50,118
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1381
02:17:02,298 --> 02:17:04,424
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1382
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:07,969
I just wasn't quick enough.

1383
02:17:28,741 --> 02:17:30,491
Of course.

1384
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,578
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1385
02:17:35,205 --> 02:17:36,998
Thanks.

1386
02:17:38,751 --> 02:17:40,877
It's all right, Ginny.

1387
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:44,213
It's over.

1388
02:17:45,215 --> 02:17:47,759
It's just a memory.

1389
02:17:50,679 --> 02:17:56,017
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1390
02:18:07,279 --> 02:18:09,948

You both realize, of course...

1391
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:15,620
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1392
02:18:16,246 --> 02:18:17,288
Yes, sir.

1393
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:20,708
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1394
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:22,043
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1395
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:25,004
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1396
02:18:26,548 --> 02:18:28,800
...that you both receive...

1397
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:33,388
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1398
02:18:35,516 --> 02:18:37,308
Thanks, sir.

1399
02:18:37,893 --> 02:18:40,228
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1400
02:18:40,396 --> 02:18:44,565
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1401
02:18:45,651 --> 02:18:50,405
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1402
02:18:53,117 --> 02:18:55,076
Harry.

1403
02:18:55,411 --> 02:18:59,747
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1404
02:19:00,332 --> 02:19:03,835
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1405
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:09,298
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1406
02:19:11,677 --> 02:19:13,261
And...

1407
02:19:13,804 --> 02:19:15,263
...second...

1408
02:19:15,431 --> 02:19:20,184
...l sense that something
is troubling you.

1409
02:19:20,436 --> 02:19:22,937
Am l right, Harry?

1410
02:19:24,773 --> 02:19:26,482
It's just...

1411
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:32,363
You see, sir, l couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1412
02:19:32,573 --> 02:19:38,202
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1413
02:19:38,787 --> 02:19:39,954
I see.

1414
02:19:40,122 --> 02:19:45,960
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1415
02:19:46,378 --> 02:19:51,883
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1416
02:19:53,135 --> 02:19:55,845
If l'm not mistaken, Harry...

1417
02:19:56,221 --> 02:20:00,058
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1418
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:03,186
...the night he gave you that scar.

1419
02:20:03,353 --> 02:20:07,231
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1420
02:20:07,483 --> 02:20:08,983
Uh-huh.

1421
02:20:09,151 --> 02:20:11,861
Not intentionally...

1422
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:14,655
...but yes.

1423
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:19,911
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1424
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:24,916
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1425
02:20:25,125 --> 02:20:27,919
Determination, resourcefulness...

1426
02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:32,131
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1427
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:36,844
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1428
02:20:37,679 --> 02:20:41,349
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1429
02:20:41,517 --> 02:20:43,559
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1430
02:20:43,727 --> 02:20:47,647
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1431
02:20:47,898 --> 02:20:50,024
It is our choices.

1432
02:20:53,695 --> 02:20:57,115
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1433
02:20:57,282 --> 02:21:02,203
...then l suggest
you look more closely at this.

1434
02:21:03,205 --> 02:21:04,872
Be careful.

1435
02:21:10,546 --> 02:21:13,214
Godric Gryffindor.

1436
02:21:13,382 --> 02:21:17,426
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1437
02:21:26,311 --> 02:21:27,728

Dobby.

1438
02:21:28,981 --> 02:21:33,401
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1439
02:21:35,571 --> 02:21:38,906
I'll deal with you later.

1440
02:21:44,746 --> 02:21:46,330
LUClUS:
Out of my way, Potter.

1441
02:21:46,498 --> 02:21:50,084
So it's true. You have returned.

1442
02:21:50,752 --> 02:21:53,588
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1443
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:57,925
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1444
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,094
Ridiculous.

1445
02:22:00,262 --> 02:22:02,763

Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1446
02:22:02,973 --> 02:22:06,642
...were under the impression
that you would curse their families...

1447
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:09,645
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1448
02:22:10,105 --> 02:22:13,608
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1449
02:22:13,775 --> 02:22:17,528
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1450
02:22:17,738 --> 02:22:20,531
...the welfare of this school...

1451
02:22:20,741 --> 02:22:24,994
...and, of course, its students.

1452
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:33,294
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1453
02:22:33,629 --> 02:22:35,171
Oh, yes.

1454
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:38,633
And?

1455
02:22:39,801 --> 02:22:41,802
Who was it?

1456
02:22:48,268 --> 02:22:51,646
- Voldemort.
- Ah.

1457
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:57,401
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1458
02:22:57,986 --> 02:23:01,572
...by means of this.

1459
02:23:04,284 --> 02:23:05,826
I see.

1460
02:23:07,287 --> 02:23:11,499
 Fortunately,
our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

1461
02:23:11,833 --> 02:23:15,503
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1462
02:23:15,671 --> 02:23:18,881
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1463
02:23:19,216 --> 02:23:23,177
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1464
02:23:23,512 --> 02:23:25,388
...severe.

1465
02:23:26,848 --> 02:23:29,600
Well, let us hope...

1466
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:35,356
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1467
02:23:36,066 --> 02:23:39,860
Don't worry. l will be.

1468
02:23:48,578 --> 02:23:50,621
Dumbledore.

1469
02:23:51,748 --> 02:23:55,334
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1470
02:24:12,561 --> 02:24:17,064
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1471
02:24:23,447 --> 02:24:25,072

Mr. Malfoy.

1472
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,408
Mr. Malfoy!

1473
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:30,077
I have something of yours.

1474
02:24:31,747 --> 02:24:34,665
Mine? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1475
02:24:34,875 --> 02:24:36,417
Oh, l think you do, sir.

1476
02:24:36,585 --> 02:24:39,670
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1477
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:41,255
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1478
02:24:41,965 --> 02:24:44,508
You do, do you?

1479
02:24:51,892 --> 02:24:54,935
Why don't you prove it?

1480
02:25:01,193 --> 02:25:03,402
Come, Dobby.

1481
02:25:04,654 --> 02:25:06,697
Open it.

1482
02:25:10,202 --> 02:25:11,786
Dobby.

1483
02:25:11,953 --> 02:25:15,122
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1484
02:25:15,415 --> 02:25:17,458
What? l didn't give-

1485
02:25:17,626 --> 02:25:21,337
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1486
02:25:21,505 --> 02:25:24,548
Dobby is free.

1487
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:34,850
You lost me my servant!

1488
02:25:41,817 --> 02:25:45,820
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1489
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:55,955
Hm.

1490
02:25:57,999 --> 02:26:01,669
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1491
02:26:01,837 --> 02:26:05,005
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1492
02:26:05,173 --> 02:26:10,386
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1493
02:26:16,101 --> 02:26:22,022
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1494
02:26:22,357 --> 02:26:26,610
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1495
02:26:28,572 --> 02:26:31,031
Never try to save my life again.

1496
02:26:37,205 --> 02:26:40,207
 Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1497
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:42,877
 Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1498
02:26:43,044 --> 02:26:45,921
 Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1499
02:26:47,299 --> 02:26:49,550
Hello.

1500
02:26:51,219 --> 02:26:55,890
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1501
02:26:59,102 --> 02:27:02,438
Harry. It's Hermione.

1502
02:27:23,793 --> 02:27:28,422
Uh, um, ahem.

1503
02:27:29,257 --> 02:27:32,968
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- lt's good to be back.

1504
02:27:33,136 --> 02:27:35,763
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1505
02:27:35,931 --> 02:27:38,140
We had loads of help from you.

1506
02:27:38,308 --> 02:27:41,519
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1507
02:27:43,355 --> 02:27:46,315
Could l have your attention, please?

1508
02:27:50,487 --> 02:27:52,988
Before we begin the feast...

1509
02:27:53,156 --> 02:27:59,453
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1510
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:03,707
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1511
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:06,585
...to all who had been Petrified.

1512
02:28:17,097 --> 02:28:20,057
Also, in light of the recent events...

1513
02:28:20,225 --> 02:28:22,393
...as a school treat...

1514
02:28:22,602 --> 02:28:26,522
...all exams have been canceled.

1515
02:28:29,192 --> 02:28:30,818
oh, no.

1516
02:28:47,711 --> 02:28:49,753
Sorry l'm late.

1517
02:28:55,844 --> 02:29:00,222
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1518
02:29:00,557 --> 02:29:03,851
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1519
02:29:19,659 --> 02:29:25,664
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1520
02:29:25,874 --> 02:29:28,792
...and Hermione, of course...

1521
02:29:29,461 --> 02:29:33,547
...l would still be you-know-where...

1522
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:37,301
...so l'd just like to say thanks.

1523
02:29:46,728 --> 02:29:49,688
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
